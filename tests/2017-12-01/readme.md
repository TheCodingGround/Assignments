1. Write a function that will return "And" if both the Conditions are met, "Or" if only one of the conditions are met or "None" if neither of the conditions are met. The function should take one argument and should check if it is an integer and if it is greater than 0. Name the function yourself.



ExampleFunction(1) = "And"

ExampleFunction(-1) = "Or"

ExampleFunction("a") = "None"


2. Write a function that takes 3 arguments, an array of numbers, a number and a string that will either be "GreaterOrEqual" or "LessThan" and return an array of numbers where the numbers are Greater Or Equal if the third argument is "GreaterOrEqual", or less than if the third argument is "LessThan". Give an appropriate name for the function.

This function should use a for loop.


ExampleFunction([1,2,3,4,5,6,7], 3, "GreaterOrEqual") = [3,4,5,6,7]


ExampleFunction([1,2,3,4,5,6,7], 5, "LessThan") = [1,2,3,4]

3. Similar to the previous question: Write a function that takes 3 arguments, an array of numbers, a number and a string that will either be "GreaterOrEqual" or "LessThan" and return an array of numbers where the numbers are Greater Or Equal if the third argument is "GreaterOrEqual", or less than if the third argument is "LessThan". Give an appropriate name for the function.

This function should not use a for loop.


ExampleFunction([1,2,3,4,5,6,7], 3, "GreaterOrEqual") = [3,4,5,6,7]

ExampleFunction([1,2,3,4,5,6,7], 5, "LessThan") = [1,2,3,4]

4. Create a function that will return true if the second argument (string) is in the first argument (string). Please create your own name for the function, do not use the example.

someFunctionName('Perfect Practice Makes Perfect', 'Perfect') = True

someFunctionName('We should have a growth Mindset', 'Fixed') = False
