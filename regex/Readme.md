Definition: 

A regular expression (regex or regexp for short) is a special text string for describing a search pattern. 
You can think of regular expressions as wildcards on steroids. 
You are probably familiar with wildcard notations such as *.txt to find all text files in a file manager. 
The regex equivalent is ^.*\.txt$.
